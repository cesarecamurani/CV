## Profile

After 15 years spent as a hospitality professional i decided to challenge myself starting this amazing journey to become a professional Software Developer at Makers Academy! I'm passionate, eager to learn and to genuinely contribute to the growth of my Team in a future workplace.
I will bring with me loads of enthusiasm, a positive attitude towards new challenges and a passion for details cultivated in years of hard work in a very challenging industry like hospitality.

## Projects

[Dungeon Hero](https://github.com/cesarecamurani/dungeon-hero): <br> As our final project at Makers we decided, together with our team, to challenge ourselves creating a procedurally generated adventure game (Rogue - like) using vanilla JavaScript. You can play it here: <br> <a href="https://cesarecamurani.github.io/dungeon-hero/">https://cesarecamurani.github.io/dungeon-hero/</a>. <br>
Technologies: JavaScript, JQuery, HTML5, CSS <br>
Testing Frameworks: Jasmine, Istanbul, ESlint, Travis CI 
<br><br>
[Acebook](https://github.com/cesarecamurani/acebook-firenze): <br> In this project (part of week 8 and 9 at Makers Academy) we worked in a team of four to create our version of Facebook using Ruby on Rails. Here's the link to Heroku: https://acebook-firenze.herokuapp.com/. <br>
Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Heroku, HTML5, CSS <br>
Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Capybara, Travis CI 
<br><br>
[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/cesarecamurani/Bank-Tech-Test): <br> Tech test where we've been asked to create an application able to create and manage a basic bank account, trying to keep our code as cleaner as possible while following a strict TDD process. <br>
Technologies: Ruby <br>
Testing Frameworks: RSpec
<br><br>
[Thermostat](https://github.com/cesarecamurani/Thermostat-JavaScript): <br> A simple single page Thermostat application created using JavaScript and JQuery - my very first project in JS. <br>

Testing Frameworks: Jasmine

## Skills

#### Test Driven Development

One of the main focuses of Makers Academy is Test Driven Development.
From the very first day we've been taught about the primary importance of following a strict TDD process while coding, and after an initial struggle i quickly understood why is so important.
Following a good TDD process while implementing your code is highly beneficial in terms of better code quality, with considerably less bugs and therefore time and money saving in the long run, and makes your code much more easier to change.
During the course at Makers Academy i had the opportunity to learn and use testing frameworks such as RSpec, Jasmine, Jest, Capybara amongst others.

#### Fast Learner

I've always loved learning new things, especially in relation to Technology, Science, History, Psichology.
During my journey at Makers Academy i've been surprised by the amount of things we've been able to assimilate in a very short amount of time(sometimes we've been given only a few days to learn a completely new programming language) and the way we were able to use them right away in our projects.
The whole course had its focus on make us able to quickly learn new things by ourselves.
I'm therefore quite confident in the fact that i will be able to pick up new concepts and learn new languages fairly quickly in a future work environment.
